# Haskell Types: a recap (1)

Algebraic Data Types

* Sum types:

~~~~ {.haskell}
data SumType a b = C1 a | C2 b -- Either a b
~~~~

* Product types:

~~~~ {.haskell}
data ProductType a b = MkP a b -- (a, b)
~~~~

. . .

* Any combination of the two

~~~~ {.haskell}
data MyNonsensicalDataType =
    C1 String Int Bool
  | C2 Int Char (Double, Double) (Maybe Bool) String
~~~~

# Haskell Types: a recap (2)

* Commonly used types:

~~~~ {.haskell}
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
data Either a b = Left a | Right b

-- syntactic sugar ahead
data [] a = [] | a : ([] a) -- [a]
data (,) a b = (,) a b -- (a, b)
~~~~

# Type Classes: constraints

~~~~ {.haskell}
(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
show :: Show a => a -> String
(>) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool
~~~~

# Type Classes: definition

* Interfaces for types sharing a common property
* Example: `Float` and `Int` are both `Num`s
* Example: `Show`

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Show a where
    show :: a -> String
~~~~

# Type Classes: definition (2)

* Each type has its own implementation
* **Ad-hoc polymorphism**

~~~~ {.haskell}
instance Show MyType where
	show x = ...
~~~~

# Ad-hoc Polymorphism: defining instances

* Want to convert type to `String`
* `toString` in Java

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Show a where
    show :: a -> String
~~~~

~~~~ {.haskell}
data Container a = Empty | Holding a

instance Show (Container Int) where
    show (Holding x) = "[ " ++ show x ++ " ]"
    show _           = "[ ]"
~~~~

# Common Type Classes: Num

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Num a where
    (+), (-), (*) :: a -> a -> a
    negate :: a -> a
    abs :: a -> a
    signum :: a -> a
    fromInteger :: Integer -> a

    x - y = x + negate y
    negate x = 0 - x
~~~~

* Define all but one of `(-)` and `negate`

# Common Type Classes: Ord

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Eq a => Ord a where
	-- minimal complete definition:
	-- compare or <=
    compare :: a -> a -> Ordering
    (<), (<=), (>), (>=) :: a -> a -> Bool
    max, min :: a -> a -> a

data Ordering = LT | EQ | GT
~~~~

* Example: sorting

~~~~ {.haskell}
sort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
~~~~

# Hands-on

~~~~ {.haskell}
data Person = P
  { pnc :: String -- Int?
  , name :: String
  , age :: Int
  , married :: Bool
  } deriving Show
~~~~

* `Eq` instance for `Person`

~~~~ {.haskell}
instance Eq Person where
  p1 == p2 = pnc p1 == pnc p2
~~~~

# Hands-on (2)

* Parameterize pnc

~~~~ {.haskell}
data Person2 a = P2
  { pnc2 :: a
  , name2 :: String
  , age2 :: Int
  , married2 :: Bool
  } deriving Show
~~~~

* `Eq` instance for `Person2`

~~~~ {.haskell}
instance Eq (Person2 a) where
  p1 == p2 = pnc2 p1 == pnc2 p2
~~~~

# Hands-on (3)

~~~~ {.haskell}
instance Eq a => Eq (Person2 a) where
  p1 == p2 = pnc2 p1 == pnc2 p2
~~~~

# Digression

## Types have types!

* **kind**: the type of a type

~~~~ {.haskell}
> :k Int
Int :: *
> :k Maybe
Maybe :: * -> *
> :k Maybe Int
Maybe Int :: *
~~~~

. . .

* Useful for describing parametric types
* Haskell code should have a well-formed type
	* i.e. having the kind `*`

# Type Classes for Parametric Types

* Parametric types can be polymorphic too
* Example: What is the type of **all** "containers"?

. . .

~~~~ {.haskell}
container :: c a
~~~~

# Type Classes for Parametric Types (2)

* We want a `map`-like operation on trees
* We want a `map`-like operation on containers
* We want a function `f :: (a -> b) -> c a -> c b` where `c` is a
  container-type
	* Note: `c` has kind `* -> *`

# Functors

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Functor f where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
~~~~

# Functors (2)

* Functors are mathematical objects!

~~~~ {.haskell}
fmap :: (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)
~~~~

* `fmap` "lifts" a function to the (parametric) type `f`

# Hands-on Functors

~~~~ {.haskell}
data Container a = Empty | Holding a
  deriving (Show, Eq)
~~~~

* Define `fmap` for `Container`
* Definition is identical for `Maybe`

# Custom Type Classes

* Source: \url{learnyouahaskell.com}

~~~~ {.haskell}
class YesNo a where
  yesno :: a -> Bool
~~~~

* Define `yesno` for the following types:
	* `Bool`
	* `Int`
	* `[a]`
	* `Maybe a`

# Monads (0)

### "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors, what's the problem?"

# Monads (1)

* Functors map functions to containers
* Monads generalize computations over containers

# Monads (2)

~~~~ {.haskell}
class Monad m where
    (>>=)	:: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
    return	:: a -> m a
~~~~

* `(>>=)` is also called **bind**
* `return` is called **return** (for some reason)

# Maybes are Monads (1)

* Getting some intuition:

~~~~ {.haskell}
return :: a -> Maybe a
(>>=)  :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
~~~~

* Definition(s) for `return`
* Definition(s) for `(>>=)`

# Maybes are Monads (2)

* Getting some intuition:

~~~~ {.haskell}
return :: a -> Maybe a
(>>=)  :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
~~~~

* `return`: put a value in the container
* `(>>=)`:
	* extract value from container, `Maybe a`
	* perform computation, `a -> Maybe b`
	* return result, `Maybe b`

# Maybes are Monads: hands-on (1)

~~~~ {.haskell}
> let f x = Just $ 2 + x
> Just 3 >>= f
> Nothing >>= f
~~~~

* Advantage: can easily chain computations

~~~~ {.haskell}
> Just 3 >>= (Just . (2 +)) >>= (Just . (* 5))
~~~~

# Maybes are Monads: hands-on (2)

~~~~ {.haskell}
return         = Just
Just x  >>= f  = f x
Nothing >>= _  = Nothing
~~~~

* Can rewrite previous chain:

~~~~ {.haskell}
> return 3 >>= return . (2 +) >>= return . (* 5)
~~~~

# Maybes are Monads: hands-on (3)

* Binding looks similar to imperative programing
* Do-notation:

~~~~ {.haskell}
computation :: Num a => Maybe a -> Maybe a
computation m = do
  x <- m -- extract value, if it exists
  y <- return $ 2 + x
  z <- return $ y * 5
  return z
~~~~

* Note: `return` doesn't "end" the function!

# Maybes are Monads: hands-on (4)

* Cleaner style:

~~~~ {.haskell}
computation :: Num a => Maybe a -> Maybe a
computation m = do
  x <- m -- extract value, if it exists
  let y = 2 + x -- m is the only possible failure
  return $ y * 5
~~~~

# Other Monads

* Lists
* Functions
* Global state/"the outside world"
	* `State`
	* `IO`

# Extra: Limitations of Haskell's Type System

* Type inference automatically finds/checks the right type for us
* ... because all computations on types terminate,
* ... so Haskell types are not first-class values.

# Extra: Limitations of Haskell's Type System (2)

* Example 1: prove that `map` preserves list length
* Example 2: restrict a type to a subset of its values (remember `Nat`)

* Alternative: **dependent types** (Agda, Idris)
	* Types that depend on values
	* Trade-off: they make type checking more difficult

# Extra: Type Systems vs. Real World

* Strongly-typed programs, **sound** type system

* Translated into **weakly-typed** machine code

* Type erasure: deleting types **preserves** program semantics
	* Assuming the compiler is correct
